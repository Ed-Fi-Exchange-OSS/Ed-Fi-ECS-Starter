# Ed-Fi ECS Starter

This repository contains the codebase and instructions on how to deploy the Ed-Fi ODS Web API to AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS). The general idea of this repository is to compile multiple methods of achieving the deployment. As the community collaborates, we anticipate discovering more methods.


### Deploying Ed-Fi ODS to ECS with [Terraform Scripts](src/terraform).

Please check Terraform Scripts [README.md](src/terraform/README.md) for detailed instructions.
